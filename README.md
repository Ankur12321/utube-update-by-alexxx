## Info

#### Project Update

This is a simple hobby project which I was really curious about to implement. I [Ankit Kumar](https://github.com/alpha-alexxx/) have recently modified the code, incorporating additional functions, commands, and ensuring compatibility with the latest versions of libraries.

#### Project Overview

The project involves the development of a Telegram bot utilizing the [Youtube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/ "Youtube Data API v3"). The primary purpose of the bot is to facilitate the seamless uploading of videos to YouTube.

For more details about the original project, you can refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/odysseusmax/utube).

**Getting your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`**

Certainly! To obtain the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` for the YouTube Data API v3 from the Google Cloud Console, you can follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Create a Project on Google Cloud Console

1.  Open the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2.  Click on the project drop-down menu at the top of the page and select **[New Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate)**.
3.  Enter a name for your project - 'Youtube Uploader' and click **Create**.

#### Step 2: Enable the YouTube Data API v3

1.  In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the [APIs & Services Dashboard](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
2.  Click on **\+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES**.
3.  Search for "**YouTube Data API v3**" and select it.
4.  Click **Enable**.

#### Step 3: Create Credentials

1.  In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the [Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).
2.  Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.

**Activate Python virtual Environment**
```python
python3 -m venv venv
```
**Go to Venv**
```python
source venv/bin/activate
```

**Install requirements**
```python
 pip3 install -r requirements.txt

### Development Status
[![Active](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/alpha-alexxx/YoutubeUploader)

üöÄ **Active Development:** I am currently actively working on this project, implementing new features, fixing issues, and making continuous improvements. Your contributions and feedback are always welcome!

### Special notes
1. With the Youtube Data API you are awarded with 10,000 points of requests. For one video upload it costs 1605 points, regardless of file size, which calculates to about 6 uploads daily. Once you have exhausted your daily points, you have to wait till daily reset. Resets happens at 0:00 PST, i.e. 12:30 IST. So make your uploads count.
2. Uploading copyright contents will leads to immediate blocking of the video.

3. By default, all the videos are uploaded as private with random category id unless you provide `UPLOAD_MODE` and `VIDEO_CATEGORY`. You may change it after youtube processes the video.

### Commands

Edit the bot in [**BotFather**](https://t.me/BotFather) with command `/help` ‚Æû `/mybots` ‚Æû choose your bot by the username ‚Æû click on Edit bot ‚Æû click on edit commands ‚Æû copy the below code and paste there and save it.
